     (NX-295 / RT28203)

  - Fixed correct dependency-order for top-nodes feature-set and install.
     (NX-297 / RT28291)

Enhancements:

  - Nexus NED does not support multiple servers in the radius group (added
     ordered-by user to /aaa/group/server/radius/server and
     /aaa/group/server/tacacs-plus/server)
     (NX-278 / RT27930)

cisco-nx v4.4.4 [2017-05-09]
================================================================================

Corrections:

  - Added cli-diff-delete-before to /interface/*/ip/static/secondary-addr to be
    able to change primary adress to 2nd and then remove it in same transaction.
    NOTE: This only works with NSO versions >= 3.4.9, 4.1.6, 4.2.2, 4.3, 4.4
     (NX-293 / RT28163)

Enhancements:

  - Added /route-map/set/ip/next-hop/verify-availability/track
     (NX-289 / RT28115)

  - Added missing config under /route-map/set/ipv6/next-hop
     (NX-291 / RT28131)

  - Added support for IPV6 monitor erspan configuration
     (NX-292 / RT28144)

  - Added show-interface-all feature to nxapi too (see README)
     (NX-294 / RT28169)

  - Added top leaf switchname (NOTE: should be choice, but NSO doesn't allow
    choices on top-level, so care must be taken when using it together with
    top-level leaf hostname).

YANG model changes since 4.4.3:

cisco-nx v4.4.3 [2017-05-01]
================================================================================

Corrections:

  - Fixed deletion of sub-interface when implicitly removed because
    main-interface toggles to L2 in same transaction
     (NX-287 / RT28059)

Enhancements:

cisco-nx v4.4.2 [2017-04-22]
================================================================================

Corrections:

  - Fixed banner to be able to use exclamation-mark as delimeter
     (NX-276 / RT27863)

Enhancements:

    order of threshold/timeout values when changed (device constraints)
     (NX-274 / RT27851)

  - Added /bridge-domain/ip/igmp/snooping-disable/snooping to be able to disable
    igmp snooping (i.e. to work with device syntax 'no ip igmp snooping' as
    boolean-no leaf).
     (NX-277 / RT27931)

  - Changed /aaa/group/server/radius/server to list to allow multiple servers in
    the radius group (i.e. now same as tacacs+).
     (NX-278 / RT27930)

cisco-nx v4.4 [2017-03-31]
================================================================================
Changes that might affect a package upgrade from release 4.3.7 and earlier:
  See sections 'Removed lists' and 'Removed leaves' below.

Corrections:

  - Corrected faulty model for /ip/community-list/(expanded|standard). Model
    previously had permit and deny as separate lists, this is wrong since on
    device these are mutually exclusive for a specific entry, hence permit/deny
    is now modeled as a prefix-key.
     (NX-263 / RT27614)

Enhancements:

  - Fixed vrf-member-l3-redeploy for sub-interfaces.
     (NX-234 / RT26848)

  - Fixed faulty key + annotation on /router/ospf/area/range
     (NX-261 / RT27543)

  - Added disable-peer-as-check under bgp neighbor address-family.
     (NX-262 / RT27599)

  - Added IETF per-Link bfd (RFC 7130) to /interface/port-channel
     (NX-265 / RT27633)

  - Added same heurisitics to NXAPI as CLI for determining errors in
    transactions. For example, to handle warning as error when trying to add
    restricted VLAN range to bridge-domain.
     (NX-266 / RT27651)

  - Added more leaves to /hardware/access-list/tcam/region.
     (NX-267 / RT27659)

  - Added local-as to neighbor in router bgp + explicit-exit to avoid misplacement
     (NX-256 / RT27432)

    empty leaf in choice to reflect real device behaviour.
     (NX-250 / RT27302)


Enhancements:

  - Added retry to NXAPI mode. Also added ned-settings to control
    retry-count/delay (same settings used for CLI, see README, section 9)

  - Added some more leaves in /hardware/access-list/tcam/region
     (NX-249 / RT27299)

    (i.e. when using ned-setting 'vrf-member-l3-redeploy')
     (NX-234 / RT26848)

  - Fixed delete of /router/ospf/area/stub (needed explicit delete, but presence
    container didn't reflect device-behaviour correctly)
     (NX-241 / RT27083)

  - Fixed delete of /router/ospf/area/nssa (needed explicit delete, but presence
    container didn't reflect device-behaviour correctly). Also moved out
    nssa/translate to container 'nssa-translate' outside of presence since it is
    sematically not part of the presence-container on device.
     (NX-242 / RT27084)

  - Added /ip/pim/anycast-rp
     (NX-243 / RT27131)

  - Added more config under /interface/*/ip/arp/gratuitous
     (NX-244 / RT27161)

    README).
     (NX-223 / RT26656)

    only L3-config.
     (NX-230 / RT26758)

  - Added key to /ntp/server + removed cli-sequence-commands to better reflect

    description

Solved issues:

  - Additional fix to flowcontrol handling under ethernet interfaces. Since
    default values are dynamic (inverted for FEX interfaces) the values can
    optionally always be fetched to stay in sync with device (regardless of
    default). The ned-setting 'show-interface-all' must be enabled for this
    to work.
    (NX-185)

  - Added support for new NX-OS syntax for setting add/remove dot1q ids in
    service/instance/encapsulation/ within interface instance.
    Also added:
      service/instance/shutdown
      service/instance/encapsulation/untagged/dot1q
    (NX-191)

  - Now all description leaves which are modeled with 'cli-multi-value' can be
    quoted to contain any character (enclosing quotes are stripped when sent to
    device). The leaf will be quoted when synced from device so NSO can handle
    all characters (e.g. pipe-character, '|').
    (NX-192)

  - Added /udld
    (NX-195)

  - Added /hardware/qos/ns-buffer-profile
    (NX-196)

  - Added lldp/tlv-set in ethernet interface.
    (NX-198)

  - Now handle warning "Cannot set next-hop" as error, to abort when reported.
    (NX-199)

  - Added ned-setting 'switchport-mtu-redeploy' to optionally redeploy mtu value
    on ethernet interface when switching it to switchport (i.e. to avoid reset
    to default).
    (NX-200)

  - Added hsrp/hsrp-list/ip/secondary in interfaces.
    (NX-201)

  - Remodeled /monitor/session/shut to boolen-no to avoid default to 'no shut'
    when created.
    (NX-202)

  - Added redeploy of some l3-config on vrf member change to Bdi interfaces too
    (i.e. same as ethernet and vlan interfaces with ned-setting
    'vrf-member-l3-redeploy').
    (NX-204)

  - Remodeled /monitor/session/source/vlan content to be same as in interface
    list.

Solved issues:

  - Various model additions/changes
    Some new parameters for EIGRP in /interface and /router/eigrp
    (NX-184)

  - Reverted addition of default values for /interface/flowcontrol
    Since some interface-types has an inverted default behaviour, it's better to
    leave leaf without default. Now the rollback/unset of leaf value is handled
    by toggling back to other value instead of removing leaf (i.e. instead of
    'no flowcontrol on', the NED sends 'flowcontrol off').
    (NX-185)

  - Fixed Makefile quirk, it was dependent on yang-file-enumeration order in
    "wildcard".
    (NX-189)

  - Minor model additions
    Most notably added choice for ip/address/dhcp under interfaces
    (NX-190)

  - Fixed diff-dep from /interface/Ethernet/channel-group ->

  - Added bfd in /ip/pim and /vrf/context/ip/pim
    (NX-177)

  - Added /interface/ip/pim/bfd-instance
    (NX-179)

  - Added group3 in /aaa/authentication|authorization to be able to configure 3
    groups (this was a regression due to model-change, previously modeled as
    leaf-list but old model didn't work well with actual device behaviour).
    (NX-183)

  - Added defaults for /interface/flowcontrol
    (NX-185)

  - Don't delete all dot1q mappings when changed (in

    /encapsulation/profile/vni/dot1q (related to NX-187).
    (NX-186)

  - Order needs to be maintained in /encapsulaton/profile/vni/dot1q. Re-modeled
    into list (device syntax, including sub-ranges, expanded in java).

Solved issues:

  - Added /interface/Vlan/ipv6/forward
    (NX-161)

  - Fixed broken rollback of banners
    Needed to add no-value-on-delete on leaves in banner exec+motd
    (NX-162)

  - Fixed interface join channel-group without mode
    Joining channel-group without specific mode failed because of
    faulty/duplicate channel-group line.
    (NX-164)

  - Added /ntp/source
    (NX-165)

  - Added some config under /monitor/session
    (NX-169)

  - Fixed model in /router/ospf/auto-cost
    (NX-171)

  - Fixed model in /aaa/authentication/login/console+default
    * The model didn't work correctly, the container was not modeled as a sequence.
    * The fallback configuration was removed, it was inverted, only the disabled
    case shows in config (but it was modeled as the oposite). If one needs to
    disable the fallback, one can use the "config exec" feature (see README)
    * Model of /aaa/authorization/commands and /aaa/authentication/login now
    supports second group aswell.

================================================================================
YANG model changes since 4.1.16:

  Changed nodes:
  /cli/alias/line
  /vlan/vlan-list/name

Solved issues:

  - Added ned-setting 'default-copp-profile-strict'
    To avoid sending 'no copp profile ...' for nx-os versions where the 'hidden'
    default profile is 'strict' and NSO rolls back a transaction where the
    profile was changed to something else.
    (NX-140)

  - Fixed diff-dependency to 'system vlan long-name'
    To be able to use long vlan names in same transaction as it is enabled.
    (NX-147)

  - Added ned-settings cisco-nx-transaction for alternate trans-id from device.
    To avoid doing 'show running-config' for every transaction when calculating
    trans-id, ned can now be configured to instead run the calculation on the
    device (see 'Alternative way to calculate transaction ID' in README).
    Fixed 'cli alias' to be able to contain 'special' characters (e.g. pipe).
    (NX-149)

  New lists:

  /flow/monitor/exporter
  /sampler

  Changed nodes:
  /snmp-server/enable/traps/bgp

Solved issues:

  - Moved /interface/port-channel before /interface/Ethernet in yang to avoid
    splitting Ethernet config in diff due to dependency from channel-group to
    port-channel (the splitting caused issues for dependency-reordering).
    (NX-129)

  - Added more l3-config which will be redeploy with ned-setting
    'vrf-member-l3-redeploy':
      /interface/Ethernet/ip/secondary-addr
      /interface/Vlan/fabric/forwarding/mode

  - Fixed switchport ordering issue (regression introduced in 4.1.13). Also
    fixed more ordering issues when toggling from layer2 to layer3 and vice
    versa.
    (NX-136)

  - Added support for basic netflow config.
    (NX-139)

  - Added handling of device prompt when configuring 'copp profile'
    (NX-140)

  - Fixed dependency from /interface/*/hsrp/hsrp-list/track/id to /track/id
    (NX-141)

  - Added support for 'service unsupported-transceiver'. Note that the device
    default for this setting is different between nx-os versions. The new
    ned-setting 'default-unsupported-transceiver' has been added to force which
    default to use. If none is given, the NED assumes that 'service
    unsupported-transceiver' is the hidden default for nx-os > 6.1.
    (NX-142)

  - Fixed dependency from /snmp-server/enable/traps/bgp to /feature/bgp

Solved issues:

  - Changed model of list route-target in:
    /vrf/context/address-family/ipv4|ipv6/unicast/
    To avoid problem with empty-valued key in certain service-code.
    (NX-129)

  - Added ned-setting 'vrf-member-l3-redeploy' which, when enabled, forces the
    ip address to be redeployed to ethernet and vlan interfaces after a change
    in vrf membership is done (i.e. to avoid out-of-sync of 'ip address' when
    set/reset vrf member).
    NOTE: All other l3-config must be removed in NSO within same transaction to
          avoid out-of-sync
    (NX-133)

  - Filter out 'no mtu ...' in diff when toggling interface to switchport, along
    with mtu change, since some nx-os variants disallow it and some enforce only
    default or jumbo in l2
    (NX-134)

  - Added 'interface * / ipv6 dhcp' and changed /ipv6/dhcp/relay to allow
    configuring 'option vpn'
    (NX-135)

  - Added some leaves under /hardware/access-list/tcam/region (which shows up in
    config before device reload)

cisco-nx v4.1.13 [2016-08-29]
================================================================================
Changes that might affect a package upgrade from release 4.1.12:
    IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ
    The switchport model has changed slightly, especially with respect to the
    need to explicitly set the switchport state (now acts a bit more like the
    device since 'presence' have been removed in the model). This means that one
    needs to be more explicit when working with switchport toggling (and also
    the allowed vlans in a trunk interface).

    Also, the ned-setting 'show-interface-all' has now been fine-tuned to be
    more helpful when having switchport state related problems. The model as it
    is (and was) is best behaved when the default state (i.e. 'trimmed' state)
    is 'no switchport'. When interfaces are by default 'switchport' (either
    hard-coded or by means of the 'system default switchport' setting) one might
    need to enable the 'show-interface-all' setting to avoid out-of-sync issues.

    Another major change is that the default behaviour of CLI-mode
    (cisco-nx-connection) is to always do 'copy running-config startup-config'
    after every successful transaction (previously this was the default in
    NXAPI-mode only). The ned-setting 'copy-to-startup' has been removed for
    this reason, instead a new ned-setting has been introduced:
    'cisco-nx-peristence/model' which is used to change this behaviour (see
    README). This setting can also take the value 'schedule' to be able to delay
    the copy to startup-config by means of a configured scheduler job (see
    README).


Solved issues:

  - Re-fix of fex-ports, can now be solved by using ned-setting
    'show-interface-all' (see above)
    (NX-113/rt24085)

  - Fixed ordering problem when changing 'switchport mode'
    (NX-129)

  - Fixed issue when 'switchport trunk allowed vlan' list contains many entries
    which makes device split it into several lines with 'add' keyword added.
    (NX-129)

  - Removed choices from switchport model (vlan-choice + switchport-choice).
    These could sometimes cause incorrect diffs. Also removed presence from
    switchport. The 'enable switchport' must now always be explicitly set (in
    some instances, the ned-setting 'show-interface-all' must be used). Also,
    the 'switchport trunk allowed vlan none|<ids>' must now be explilcitly
    removed when toggling from one to the other.
    (NX-129)

  - Filter out the 'time start ...' from scheduler schedules causing out-of-sync
    when scheduler jobs are scheduled to run-once (since model only covers the
    repeated schedules).
    (NX-129)

  - Fixed ordering issue in 'interface * / spanning-tree' and 'interface * /
    storm-control' in conjunction with switchport toggle.
    (NX-131)

  - Changed switchport model to be more flexible with respect to toggling and
    different defaults.
    (NX-132)

  in ipv6 static route.
  (NX-73, rt23576)

- Added ability to answer prompts when running commands with live-status exec
  any or config exec. For example to be able to give password when using command
  copy with scp, like this:
    admin@ncs# devices device nx7k live-status exec any copy running-config scp://username@1.2.3.4/tmp/bak.cfg [management, secret]
  This will send 'management' as the answer to the first prompt (i.e. vrf) and
  'secret' as the answer to the second prompt (i.e. the ssh password).
  (NX-75, rt23618)

- Remodeled node graceful-restart in /router/bgp and /router/bgp/vrf to be able
  to negate the graceful-restart. This gave rise to a structural change where

- Fixed issue when trying to remove an interface from a channel-group where a
  mode was set along with channel-group (e.g. 'channel-group 3 mode active')
  along with changing config fixed by channel-group, the re-order of commands
  didn't work resulting in abort.
  (NX-85, rt23815)

- When running live-status exec cmds regexp-characters wasn't escaped properly
  leading to confusing output sometimes (e.g. when including a '|',
  pipe-character).
  (NX-56, rt23299)

- Added diff-dependency for handling toggle between ip/ipv6 address under
  /route-map/match.
  (NX-57, rt23374)

- Changed /ip/domain-list and /vrf/context/ip/domain-list to lists

- Added tailf:cli-remove-before-change to /interface/*/ip/policy/route-map

- Fixed model for /interface/*/bandwidth, inserted wrapper-container to allow
  for setting bandwidth and inheritet bandwidth separately:
    /interface/*/bandwidth/inherited/bandwidth
    /interface/*/bandwidth/inherited/inherit

- Added key-default 'ipv4' to /interface/*/hsrp/hsrp-list for convenince.

- Added correct default value handling and changed type from empty to boolean-no

cisco-nx v4.1.1 [2016-05-27]
================================================================================

Enhancements:

- Additions to the YANG model:
    route-map * / match ipv6 access-list
    route-map * / set ipv6 next-hop
    route-map * / set tag

Corrections:

- Added tailf:cli-remove-before-change to 'route-map * / match ip access-list'

- Added tailf:cli-range-list-syntax to 'class-map type qos * / match precedence'

- Disable ned-setting 'use-show-diff' by default, unpredictable output from some
  (old?) firmware-revisions could cause out-of-sync (observed on for example a
  NX5k with nx-os 5.0).

(Issue tracker #23153, NX-50)


cisco-nx v4.1.0.1 [2016-05-19]
================================================================================

Intermediate release, only to be used with NCS-3.4.6.1 patch release.

cisco-nx v4.1 [2016-05-14]
================================================================================

Changes that might affect a package upgrade from release 4.0:
    ip access-list * /
    ipv6 access-list * /
    interface * / switchport block
    interface fc * / switchport
    interface san-port-channel * / switchport
    interface * / speed
    interface * / ip access-group *
    interface * / ipv6 port traffic-filter *
    interface * / ipv6 traffic-filter *
    interface * / encapsulation
    All uses of removed groupings:
      interface-mgmt-grouping
      interface-fc-grouping
      interface-san-grouping
      interface-eth-lldp-grouping

Enhancements:

- Additions to the YANG model:
    interface * / bfd per-link
    ip route * vrf
    ip route * track
    ipv6 route * vrf
    ipv6 route * track
    ip access-list * / statistics
    ipv6 access-list * / statistics
    ipv6 access-list * / fragments
    feature sla
    ip sla *
    ip sla schedule *
    ipv6 dhcp
    mac address-table notification
    mac address-table fabricpath
    snmp-server enable traps :
        aaa, bridge, config, callhome, cfs, feature-control, lldp, poe, stpx,
        sysmgr, system, upgrade, vtp
    snmp-server context *
    snmp-server mib community-map *
    route-map * / set nssa-only
    key chain * /
    hsrp anycast * /
    line vty / session-limit
    logging console
    logging logfile
    track * ip sla /
    track * list boolean /
    track * list threshold /
    track * / object *
    evpn esi multihoming
    interface port-channel * / ethernet-segment
    interface Ethernet * / evpn

- Added ability to run any command directly on device in both config and exec
  mode. For example to reset interfaces or run event manager applets, examples
  in ncs_cli:

    admin@ncs# devices device nx7k live-status exec any event manager run my_app

    or:

    admin@ncs(config)# devices device nx7k config exec default interface e3/1


Corrections:

- Fixed diff dependencies:
    from: vtp domain
    to:   vtp mode

    from: interface port-channel *<sub-interface>
    to:   interface port-channel *<parent-interface>

    from: bridge-domain * /
    to:   system bridge-domain

    from: interface Bdi * /
    to:   bridge-domain

    from: interface * / vpc
    to:   feature vpc

- Fixed syntax for using network+mask in ip|ipv6 access-list
  rules. (e.g. 10 permit ip 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 any)

- Removed cli-incomplete-command from destination address group (leaf addrgroup)
  in ip access-list rules.

- Changed model 'route-map * / set as-path prepend' from leaf-list to
  container. Values could contain duplicates, so now instead name-less
  multi-value string containing list of AS numbers. Also, since extra leaf
  last-as could be added, needed to be container.

- Answer 'yes' to prompt "Are you sure? ..." from device.
  For example for command: 'no cfs eth distribute'

- Moved container encapsulation from interface-common-grouping to new grouping
  ethernet-and-port-channel-grouping used from ethernet and port-channel
  interfaces, which are the types which can be parent interfaces.

- Split container lacp from interface-common-grouping into two new containers in
  groupings interface-phys-ethernet-grouping and interface-port-channel-grouping
  to reflect that the lacp settings differ between ethernet and port-channel
  interfaces.

- Renamed interface-eth-lldp-grouping to
  interface-eth-and-mgmt-grouping to contain more nodes only used in
  Ethernet and mgmt interfaces.

- Moved out nodes from interface-common-grouping:
  mac -> interface-ethernet-grouping
  mtu, delay, mac-address, hsrp, vrrp -> interface-ether-and-vlan-grouping
  fabric -> interface-vlan-grouping (not same as fabric on ethernet)
  speed, duplex -> interface-l2port-common-grouping

- Moved out nodes from interface-ethernet-grouping:
  vmware, dvport -> interface Vethernet * /
  channel-group, beacon, link -> interface-phys-ethernet-grouping
  cdp -> interface-eth-and-mgmt-grouping
  untagged -> ethernet-and-port-channel-grouping
  snmp -> interface-ether-and-vlan-grouping (corrected model to boolean-no)

- Removed interface-bfd-grouping from 'interface * Vethernet', not relevant.

- Created interface-vlan-grouping to use in interface Bdi * / too

- Removed non-existing containers 'banner login' and 'banner prompt-timeout'

- Changed name of ned-setting syntax-before-5_1 to
  port-channel-load-balance-ethernet, wrong assumption that command was present
  before nx-os 5.1. New default is to enable 'port-channel load-balance
  ethernet' when nx-os version <= 5.2.

- Filter out separate switchport command for Nexus 1000V, it doesn't behave like
  other NX-OS devices (i.e. as a presence container).

- Changed 'interface * / switchport block' to container from leaf, since both
  values multicast and unicast can be set separately.

- Changed leaf 'name' to prefix-key instead of key to reflect that there is only
  one instance per direction in the following lists:
    interface * / ip access-group
    interface * / ip port access-group
    interface * / ipv6 traffic-filter
    interface * / ipv6 port traffic-filter

- Fixed 'interface * / cdp enable', was incorrectly modeled as value, now
  cli-boolean-no with default true.

- Fixed svs connection * , should be list, incorrectly modeled as container
  'vcenter'.

- Fixed vservice global type vsg / tcp state-checks, incorrectly modeled as
  presence container.

- Changed leafref to non-strict-leafref referring to policy-map to be able to
  point to default policy-maps not shown in config (e.g. default-nq-7e-policy):
    system qos / service-policy type network-qos
    system qos / service-policy type qos input
    system qos / service-policy type qos output
    system qos / service-policy type queuing input
    system qos / service-policy type queuing output
    interface * / service-policy type network-qos (interface-ethernet-grouping)

- Fixed structure of ip|ipv6 access-list, reuses same basic structure to capture
  more use-cases. This also fixes the use of the remove-before-change annotation
  which didn't always work (i.e. whatever change to an access-list item, it
  needs to be removed before adding the new entry with same sequence
  number). Also fixed incorrect modeling with remark as separate leaf in list,
  an item is either a rule or a remark.

- Removed use of interface-switchport-grouping from interface vlan * /

- Corrected interface fc * / and interface san-port-channel * /. Now
  shares same grouping interface-fc-and-san-grouping containing common
  parts (removed uses interface-common-grouping).

- Fixed interface-switchport2-grouping used in interface fc and
  san-port-channel:
    Moved out fc and san-port-channel specifics to respective interface
    Removed presence on switchport
    Changed switchport trunk allowed vlan to switchport trunk allowed vsan
    Fixed switchport trunk mode default value
    Change "no switchport trunk mode ..." -> "switchport trunk mode on"

- Added cli-remove-before-change to interface * / vpc port-channel-number

- Fixed toggling of interface * / vpc port-channel-number and
  peer-link with diff-dependency between them.

cisco-nx v4.0 [2016-04-24]
================================================================================

This version is compatible with the following NCS/NSO versions and newer:
  - NCS 3.4.5
  - NSO 4.0.4
  - NSO 4.1.1

Changes that might affect a package upgrade from release 3.8.3:
    router bgp * / (major changes)
    router ospf * / (major changes)
    interface * / storm-control
    policy-map type queuing * / class type queuing * / priority

    Added more services to protocol-port-type used in ip access-list
    Added time-exceeded to icmp-message-type used in ip access-list
    Added key value Null0 to key next-hop of ip-route-list used in ip route *

Corrections:

- Fixed diff dependencies:
    from: interface * / ipv6 port traffic-filter *
    to:   ipv6 access-list list-name id

    from: interface * / fex associate
    to:   fex id

    from: policy-map type network-qos * / class type network-qos *
    to:   class-map type network-qos

    from: policy-map type queuing * / class type queuing *
    to:   class-map type queuing

    from: dhcp
    to:   feature dhcp

    from: service dhcp
    to:   feature dhcp

- Removed invalid presence declaration from containers:
   interface * / storm-control unicast
   interface * / storm-control broadcast
   interface * / storm-control multicast

- Corrected model for router protocol redistribution from ospf and bgp. It
  contained several non-existing entries. Also, it didn't reflect how nx-os
  actually does the redistribution (i.e. through route-map entries). The new
  model for redistribution is shared between the following locations:
    router bgp * / address-family * * /
    router bgp * / vrf * / address-family * * /
    router ospf * /
    router ospf * / vrf * /
    router ospfv3 * / vrf * /address-family ipv6 unicast /
    router ospfv3 * /address-family ipv6 unicast /

- Corrections in model for router ospf * / area * :
    filter-list was incorrectly modelled, route-map missing
    nssa, stub cleaned up and grouped into choice
    virtual-link wasn't modelled as sub-mode
    hello-interval in virtual-link didn't have default value
    retransmit-interval in virtual-link didn't have default value

- Corrected invalid models:
    router ospf * / max-lsa
    router ospf * / max-metric
    router ospf * / timers
    router ospf * / discard-route
    router ospf * / vrf * / max-lsa
    router ospf * / vrf * / max-metric
    router ospf * / vrf * / timers
    router ospf * / vrf * / discard-route

- Changed leaf to list:
    router ospf * / summary-address
    router ospf * / vrf * / summary-address

- Split grouping router-bgp-address-family-grouping:
    Now grouping router-bgp-address-family-grouping is used from:
      router bgp * / address-family * * /
      router bgp * / vrf * / address-family * * /
    And new grouping template-neighbor-common-grouping is used from:
      router bgp * / template peer * /
      router bgp * / neighbor * /
      (contains separate address-family model)
    Due to new shared grouping, model is expanded in:
     router bgp * / template peer * /
     router bgp * / neighbor * /

- Previously modeled as one name-less leaf 'next-hop' with enum of values, now
    correctly modeled as separate leaves:
    router bgp * / template peer * / address-family * * / next-hop-self
    router bgp * / neighbor * / address-family * * / next-hop-self
    router bgp * / template peer * / address-family * * / next-hop-third-party
    router bgp * / neighbor * / address-family * * / next-hop-third-party

- Added sequence as second key for route-map *

- Filter out intermittent STX (0x02) character sent from some devices (caused
  out-of-sync when using transaction-id calculation from running-config)

cisco-nx v3.8.3   [2016-03-24]
==============================

Enhancements:

 - Additions to the YANG model:
    spanning-tree pathcost
    port-channel load-balance ethernet

 - Added live-status exec commands:
    traceroute <ip-addr> vrf <vrf-name>
    ping <ip-addr> vrf <vrf-name>

 (Issue tracker #22264, #22318)


cisco-nx v3.8.2   [2016-02-26]
==============================

Corrections:

- Fixed ned-setting 'show-interface-all'

- Fixed yang-model, must use 'tailf:cli-flatten-container' to containers with
  'tailf:cli-hide-in-submode' (new yang compiler warning)


cisco-nx v3.8.1   [2016-02-19]
==============================

Enhancements:

 - Additions to the YANG model:
    value 'fabricpath' in interface * / switchport mode
    interface * / hsrp * / ip *
    interface * / bfd echo
    interface * / bfd ipv4 echo
    interface * / bfd ipv6 echo
    router bgp * / address-family * * / redistribute static
    fabricpath domain default / spf-interval
    fabricpath domain default / lsp-gen-interval
    fabricpath domain default / root-priority
    feature-set fabricpath
    feature-set fabric
    service dhcp
    install feature-set
    poap transit

  - New NED settings (see README for details)

     copy-to-startup
       Copy running config to startup config

     use-show-diff
       Use device provided configuration 'diff' to save on bandwidth

     show-interface-all
       Always fetch interface values for shutdown/switchport regardless of
       default

Corrections:

- Fixed leaf interface * / encapsulation dot1Q to be case-insensitive

- Added address type as key in list 'interface * / hsrp * /' (prteviously only
  handled ipv4 which is trimmed default).

- Fixed wrong name of leaf 'cos' in policy-map-class-network-qos-grouping
  (... class type network-qos * / set cos), was 'qos'.

cisco-nx v3.8     [2016-01-19]
==============================

Increased <ncs-min-version> to 3.4 (ncs version <3.4 doesn't handle
  non-strict-leafref dependency correctly)

Changes that might affect a package upgrade from release 3.7.4:
    Removal of typedef ipv6-prefix
    interface * / ipv6 address
    interface * / service-policy
    policy-map type qos *
    policy-map type control-plane *
    username * role
    snmp-server user * role

Enhancements:

 - Additions to the YANG model:
    interface * / ip igmp
    interface * / ip nat
    interface * / ip proxy-arp
    interface * / lacp port-priority
    policy-map type qos * / class * / set cos
    policy-map type qos * / class * / police
    policy-map type control-plane * / class * / set
    policy-map type control-plane * / class * / police conform
    policy-map type control-plane * / class * / police violate
    vtp
    vlan dot1Q
    class-map type control-plane * /
    logging / server * use-vrf
    role
    ip mroute *
    ip pim
    ip route * static
    ip nat
    vrf context * / ip mroute *
    vrf context * / ip pim
    vrf context * / ip route * static
    feature nat
    feature tunnel

Corrections:

 - Corrected model under interface * / service-policy. Previously it was not
   possible to set different policies for all types/directions. Also fixed
   dependencies to policy-map.

 - Replaced custom type ipv6-prefix with NCS built-in type
   tailf:ipv6-address-and-prefix-length. This will take advantage of NCS
   built-in canonicalization of ipv6 addresses (i.e. case-insensitivity +
   compression).

 - Replaced custom type ipv4-prefix with NCS built-in type
   tailf:ipv4-address-and-prefix-length.

 - Changed 'interface * / ipv6 address' from leaf to container to be able to
   support secondary address list and also arbitrary list as in NXOS >=
   v7.0. The behaviour is switched automatically depending on NXOS version
   detected. It can also be enabled/disabled manually with ned-setting:
      'cisco-nx-behaviours/iface-vlan-ipv6-secondary' (see README).

 - Added cli-diff-dependency from list class in grouping
   policy-map-class-qos-grouping to /class-map

 - Added default value 'default' and cli-trim-default to:
    ip name-server * use-vrf
    aaa group server tacacs-plus use-vrf
    ntp server * use-vrf

 - Removed cli-sequence-commands from tacacs-server, didn't model correct syntax.

 - Fixed handling of banner <exec|login|prompt-timeout|motd>.

 - Now handles old NXOS (<= 5.2) prompt when adding vlans to switchport trunk:
     "This will cause VLANS to be overwritten. Continue anyway? [yes]"

 - Retry command on reply: 'Error: ... wait for it to complete'

 - Added ipv6-prefix to key (union) in:
    router bgp * / address-family * * / network *

 - Added missing dependency from 'policy-map type qos|control-plane *' to
   '/nx:class-map'

 - Added ability to have custom roles defined in 'role name *' used in 'username
   * role' and 'snmp-server user * role'. Also added diff-dependency to role
   from 'username * role'.

a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

For this NED no upgrades are necessary.


===============================================================================
The Tail-f package: cisco-nx NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
