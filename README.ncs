This directory is an NCS project directory.

The following commands should issued the first time ncs is used (after a make clean):
$ make all					-- initialize netsim devices and ncs cdb
$ make start					-- start netsim testbed and ncs
$ make cli					-- connect to ncs cli
admin@ncs# devices sync-to			-- update netsim devices configuration with initial cdb data

Before pushing the project to git, clean temporary data:
$ make stop
$ make clean
